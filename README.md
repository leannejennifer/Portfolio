# Fizz Buzz problem

FizzBuzz is a simple programming exercise that involves printing numbers from 1 to a specified number (often 100). However, there's a twist:  

- If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.  
- If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.  
- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

# Solution
The solution is split into a main project and a test project.

There are multiple test cases that are then refactored into a reusable test with an input and expected output.
